# todo-app-enhanced
Add extra features on todo-app mvc on Backbone.js (http://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/)
My todo-app includes features such as edit button, priority button, different priority level with different colors, and adding ' -- done ' after finished tasks. Run index.html to run the app.

TODO list
  - Let users filter or sort by priority status.
  - Add a recycle bin for recovering deleted todos.
  - Add labels for sorting and filtering.
